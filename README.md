# DocuNet

## Overview

Docunet is a research project aimed at improving the quality of standard library documentation across major programming languages. By analyzing the structural and communicative attributes of documentation, this project seeks to enhance user comprehension and engagement, ultimately boosting software development efficiency.

## Intellectual Merit

The project examines documentation for several major programming languages, focusing on readability and consistency. We employ benchmarks for clarity, including readability metrics and eye-tracking studies, to develop a systematic framework for enhancing documentation quality.

## Broader Impact

Docunet aims to elevate software standards globally by promoting improved documentation practices. The insights gained could transform technical writing and software development education, laying the groundwork for future research.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
